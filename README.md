Cloud Computing Projects 🚀
📖 Introduction
Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, companies can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

This repository compiles resources, project reports, and study materials focused on the future trends, models, and implementation strategies in cloud computing.
